# Animinoic

Welcome to Animinoic - a latent diffusion model for weebs. This model is intended to generate high quality and detailed anime style with just a few prompts. Like other anime-style Stable Diffusion models, it also supports danbooru tags to generate images.

e.g. **_girl, cat ears, blonde hair, brown hoodie, smile, blush, cat girl, cat tails, close mouth_**

## ðŸ§¨ Diffusers

This model can be used just like any other Stable Diffusion model. For more information,
please have a look at the [Stable Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/stable_diffusion).

```python
from diffusers import DiffusionPipeline, DPMSolverMultistepScheduler
import torch

repo_id = "YoruAkio/Animinoic"

pipe = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(repo_id, torch_dtype=torch.float16)
pipe.scheduler = DPMSolverMultistepScheduler.from_config(pipe.scheduler.config)
pipe = pipe.to("cuda")

prompt = "girl, cat ears, blonde hair, brown hoodie, smile, blush, cat girl, cat tails, close mouth"

image = pipe(prompt, num_inference_steps=25).images[0]
image.save("girl.png")
```
